# HelpIsHER
HelpIsHER is a very important project for me. 
The idea is to code an extension/an app (starting with a chrome extension because it seems the easiest because I'm not a software engineer lol ), that lets the user define a hand gesture that is password protected. Using data augmentation techniques a hand pose detection model is trained, making it so that during a live video call if the gesture is made 2 times in a defined time period, it will send an alert to the person on the other side of the call, that can decide the best way to get you help. The idea of this project is to fight domestic violence  using a mix human intelligence and artificial intelligence wich is for me the best way to use IA :)
My goal is to develop a demo of a this. 
If any sofware engineers/developpers/machine learning/data scientist want to help or give me advice. I'd love to hear from you.
